# Receita Federal Payment Portal

## Overview
This Flask-based web application simulates a Brazilian Federal Revenue Service (Receita Federal) portal for tax payment regularization. Its main purpose is to handle customer data retrieval, generate payment requests via PIX, and integrate with payment APIs to facilitate tax payments. The project aims to provide a functional and authentic-looking interface for users to regularize their tax situations, simulating official processes including debt consultation, personalized warnings, and immediate payment options with simulated discounts. It incorporates features to guide users through tax debt resolution, emphasizing urgency and legal consequences, and offers a streamlined payment experience.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework) for core application logic, session management, and routing.
- **Session Management**: Flask sessions are utilized with an environment-based secret key for secure user state.
- **Logging**: Python's built-in logging module is configured for debug-level output.
- **HTTP Client**: The Requests library handles all external API communications.
- **Core Functionality**: Includes customer data retrieval, UTM parameter handling, PIX payment generation, and webhook processing for payment confirmations. Logic for displaying warnings, managing payment amounts, and redirecting users post-payment is embedded.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 is used for dynamic content rendering.
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (via CDN) provides utility-first styling.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 5.15.3 is used for visual icons.
- **Custom Fonts**: The Rawline font family is integrated for a specific typographic aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript handles interactive elements such as countdown timers, form validations, and dynamic content updates, including animated chat interfaces and modal transitions.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: The design aims for an authentic government portal look, featuring Receita Federal branding, official colors, and professional layouts. This includes formal notification designs (e.g., DARF), judicial warnings, and a comprehensive chat interface simulating interaction with a tax auditor. Modals and forms are designed for clear guidance and user experience.

### Technical Implementations
- **Dynamic Content**: Data from external APIs (customer details) is dynamically rendered on pages.
- **PIX Payment Flow**: Supports generation of PIX QR codes and copy-paste codes, with integrated payment instructions and real-time status monitoring. Authentic Brazilian PIX codes are generated following EMVCo BR Code standard, compliant with Brazilian Central Bank standards.
- **User Flow Management**: Manages user journeys from CPF lookup, debt presentation, to payment and subsequent redirection.
- **Conditional Interface**: Adapts the UI based on CPF validity, displaying either a search form or personalized debt information and payment options.
- **Chat Interface**: A multi-step chat conversation simulates interaction with a tax auditor, delivering personalized debt information, warnings, and discount offers with controlled typing delays and message progression. Includes phone number collection and persistence using Local Storage.
- **Payment Validation System**: Implements automatic payment monitoring for tax payments using Recoveryfy API, with real-time status checks and automatic redirection upon payment confirmation.
